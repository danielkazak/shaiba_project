Shaiba Generator
==============

About Shaiba:
=============
The Shaiba Generator is just a fun site, made by two friends, to make some fun about their third friend.
Basically, what it does, is to generate food sentences that Shaiba would have said when hungry.
It got some cool features, and soon enough, some of them would also be able for everyone (we just need facebook
approval).

Remember that it's just a beta version, and just for the fun, nothing more than this, and have fun! :)

App Setup:
==========
* Open your cmd, and navigate to the wanted directory.
* Run 'git clone https://github.com/danielkazak/shaiba_project.git'.
* Run 'cd shaiba_project'.
* Run 'npm install'.
* Run 'bower install'.
* Run 'grunt serve'.
* The website should be opened in your default browser, in port 9000. enjoy!
* From now on, you only need to go to shaiba_project and run 'grunt serve'.

If you don't have any of the above, the installations are:
* npm - Go to http://nodejs.org and click install.
* git - Go to http://git-scm.com/downloads and go to the right link according to your OS.
* bower - Run in your cmd 'npm install -g bower'.
* grunt - Run in your cmd 'npm install -g grunt-cli' (although 'npm install' should automatically do it for you).

How to Use the Website:
=======================
For now, only us the developers can sign in facebook through the site, so unfortunately, some of the features are
blocked for most of you. But that's gonna be solved soon enough.

What you can do for now is:
* You can get funny generated sentences in the home page, by clicking on shaiba's head.
* You can explore the hall of fame, to see what other users voted to.
* You can contact through the info.
* You can get the mobile app (if you own and android phone), to get funny sentences much more easily!

What you could do when you'd be able to log in facebook:
* Insert a beloved sentence to the hall of fame.
* Rate sentences in the hall of fame, that you haven't rated yet.
* Suggest Shaiba more dishes, nations and adjectives, and help him realize how to use it in a sentence.
