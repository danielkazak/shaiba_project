Hall of fame
------------

- User experience flow
    1. User picks rating
    2. Rating changes accordingly
    3. Sentence is being sorted according to new rating
    4. The sentence is being followed (focused upon)
    5. The sentence row color is being changed to "Attempting status" (yellow - css, fading blinking work)
    6.
        6.1 Once the prior step (5) is done, means the change was posted to parse, then change row's color to "Success status" (green)
            6.1.1 Return row to normal state.
        6.2  If the prior step (5) returned error, change row's color to "Error status" (red)
            6.2.1 Return sentence to prior rank
            6.2.2 Return sentence's row to prior position
            6.2.3 Return to normal state
    7. Alert the user accordingly


- Users' Restrictions
    1. Disable rating if no user connected
    2. If a user connects, disable the rating for the rows that already had been rated by the user
    3. When a user rate a sentence, add this information to parse
        3.1 We should decide whether we should manage a table that holds all the user-sentence combinations
            or add an array of users to the best's table.
